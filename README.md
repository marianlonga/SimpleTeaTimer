Simple Tea Timer by Marian Longa
===========================

Description
-----------
A simple tea timer which I made as my first published Android app. It has 3 presets for infusing green (3 min), black (5 min) and herbal (8 min) tea and an option to choose custom time. After a time has been selected, the counter will count down the time, showing how long you need to wait. A progress bar will also show this graphically. When the tea is ready, a bell will ring so that you won't forget to take it out. Enjoy!
